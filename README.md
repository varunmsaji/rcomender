This is a Book recomendation engine implemented in Flask app,
The books are filtered on popularity based and also collaborative filtering

 Key Features:
Popularity-based Recommendations: The app leverages the power of data to recommend books that are trending and widely loved. It taps into popularity metrics to suggest reads that are making waves in the literary world.

Collaborative Filtering Magic: Taking it a step further, I implemented collaborative filtering to provide personalized recommendations. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, the app identifies patterns and suggests books that align with individual tastes.

Tech stack

Flask: The web app is built on Flask, a lightweight and powerful web framework in Python. Flask's simplicity and flexibility allowed me to focus on the core functionality of the app.

Python: The backbone of the project, Python handled data preprocessing, collaborative filtering algorithms, and interfacing with Flask.

Pandas and NumPy: These data manipulation libraries played a crucial role in preparing and structuring the data for effective recommendation generation.
